MY PROJECT NAME:- ELECTOMART ECOMMERCE PROJECT.
DESCRIPTION:- OUR PROJECT IS MICRO-ECOMMERCE PROJECT
WHERE WE SELL ELECTRONICS LIKE MOBILE PHONES LIKE APPLE AND SAMSUNG AND EARPODS.
WE HAVE 2 PERSONAS ONE IS SELLER AND ONE IS BUYER .

● SELLER CAN SELL HIS PRODUCTS BY REGISTERING INTO THE APPLICATION, IF HE IS ALREADY REGISTERED HE CAN DIRECTLY LOGGED IN. AFTER THAT WITH THE HELP OF ADD PRODUCTS HE CAN SELL PRODUCTS OF HIS COMPANY AND HE CAN SEE THEM IN PRODUCT LIST PAGE. HE CAN MODIFY
THE ADDED PRODUCTS AND DELETE IF HE WANTS TOO. SELLER HAVE EDIT PROFILE OPTION TO MODIFY THE PHONE NUMBER AND ADDRESS OF COMPANY. EVERY SELLER CAN SEE THEIR REVENUE BY SEEING THE ORDER LIST IN THE DASHBOARD. HE CAN SEE THE PRODUCTS OF USER ORDERED AND REVENUE HE
GENERATED FROM ALL PRODUCTS.

● NOW THE SECOND PERSONA IS BUYER/USER. THE USERS NEED TO REGISTERED TO ACCESS THE PRODUCTS INFORMATION AND BUY THEM. IF HE ALREADY REGISTERED HE CAN DIRECTLY LOGIN USING EMAIL AND
PASSWORD. AFTER LOGIN, THE USERS ARE READY TO SHOP, IF HE LIKES HE CAN ADD THEM INTO CART WHERE HE CAN EDIT THE ORDER, IF HE WANT HE CAN DELETE THE CART ITEM USING THE DELETE OPTION. HE CAN INCREASE THE QUANTITY AS
MUCH AS HE NEEDS. AFTER ADDING THE PRODUCTS INTO CART HE CAN PAY THE AMOUNT BY USING THE CARD DETAILS OF HIS PERSONAL
CARD. AFTER PAYMENT HE CAN GET THE PAYMENT SUCCESS MESSAGE ON UI. THE USER CAN SEE ALL THE ORDERS IN THEIR ORDER CONFIRM PAGE.
IF ANY OF THE USER IS HAVING TROUBLE HE CAN DIRECTLY RAISE A TICKET SO RESPECTED ADMIN HAVE A CONTROL THEM AND RESOLVE.
THE USER CAN EDIT THE PROFILE USING THE EDIT PROFILE PAGE.
FOR BUYER AND SELLER REGISTRATION I HAVE ADDED SWAGGER DOCUMENTATION SO DIRECTLY WE CAN TRIGGER THE APIS TO TEST THEM.
